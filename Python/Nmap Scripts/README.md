## Nmap
A python 3 library that facilitates the use of nmap with python3. Nmap is a network tool which can be used to survey a network for open ports or hosts. The tool helps the user to automate nmap functions.
The tool is by default not illegal but should be used on PC's that is not your own.



#### Credits
Full credits should go to the creator of Nmap for Python3 as I merely used the tool to create my own script
